            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And, in a word, thou shalt see the pith and substance of the best Writers, (whether old, or new) that haue taken paines to shew the true sense of this Epistle. Not to speake of those slender poynis of Doctrine, which I (the least of all Gods Prophets) did by the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, collect. That which I intend, is the edifying of Sions Inhabitants, and the further building of them vp, in the most holy saith. As my intent is good, so let thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation be: bee not too rash in thy censure; but first read, and then iudge, and be sure charitably to interpret (as Christians ought) all things in the best sense.</p>

The Author of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7911:5"/>was <hi>GOD,</hi> as appeares both by the dignitie of things written in it, and the maiestie of the stile; as also by the consent of the Church in all ages. The writer of it was <hi>Paul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Writer.</note> as may appeare by these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
<list>
                  <item>1. his name is prefixed:</item>
                  <item>2. the stile and phrase bewrayes it to be his:</item>
                  <item>3. the conclusion shewes that it is his, and no counterfeit.</item>
               </list> The occasion of writing this Epistle,<note place="margin">3. Occasion of writing.</note> may be gathered out of the second and fourth Chapters of the former Epistle: For in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, and 17<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse, <hi>Paul</hi> promised to come to them to perfect that which was lacking in their faith: And in the fourth Chapter, and 16<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse, he speaks of Christs second comming, and seemes to reckon himselfe amongst those that then should liue; vpon which words not rightly vnderstood (for <hi>Paul</hi> did not meane that he should then be aliue; but vseth a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the <hi>species; we which liue,</hi> that is, we men: the like speech see in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51, 52.) did arise a false opinion, to wit, that Christ should come to iudgement, in that age, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> liued. Now when as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of going to them was taken away, he writes this second Epistle, partly to manifest that he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, tho he came not according to promise; partly, to root out that false opinion, that was in them, touching the speedie comming of Christ; as also to admonish them, more diligently, to restraine idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, against whom he had sparingly spoken in his former Epistle. The summe of the Epistle is this: In the first Chapter the Apostle comforts them against persecutions, which they suffered for the Gospell: In the second, he admonisheth them not to hearken to such, as said, that the comming of the Lord was at hand; whereupon he takes occasion to foretell Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs comming, which should precede it: In the third Chapter he exhorts to diuers Christian duties. The whole Epistle consists of three parts:<note place="margin">Summe of the Epistle.</note> a preface, vers. 1, 2: matter of the Epistle, from the third verse of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7911:5"/>the first Chapter to the sixteenth of the third: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, from the sixteenth verse to the end of the Chapter. Come we now to the Text.</p>

Againe, it tends greatly to the hinderance of them that are comming on, and in the way to the truth, and doth greatly dishonor the truth. Come we now to the words: In which we will note,

                  <p>It is our duty as to pray for you vncessantly,<note place="margin">Sense.</note> so to praise God for you, who are our brethren spiritually, because that God, out of the free loue that he bore vnto you, hath from eternity elected you vnto saluation: the word in greeke is very emphaticall, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as if he should say, he hath pulled you with his hand out of the pit of destruction, <hi>through the sanctification of his spirit,</hi> that is, through sanctification wrought by the spirit, and <hi>beleefe of the truth,</hi> that is, true beleefe, or beleefe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the truth: opposite to a dead and false beleefe, and to a beleefe embracing errors: <hi>Whereunto,</hi> that is, to which saluation, sanctification, and faith, God (who is the author, and inspirer of the Gospell) hath called you, effectually, by the Gospell preached, which is ours in respect of dispensation, to <hi>the obtayning of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> That is, that yee may be conformed to him in glory, and be inuested with the same glory for qualitie, tho not for quantity.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines follow.</p>
                  <p>We must thanke God for his blessings vpon others,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. Giue thanks for Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings on others.</note> aswell as vpon our selues: <hi>thanksgiuing must be made for all men.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p>We are all fellow-members and therefore must be thankfull for the good one of another. <label type="milestone">

                     </label> If we looke into <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, we shall finde that he is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in his thanksgiuings for blessings bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:7911:41"/>

                     </label> then we must be farre from repining at the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our brethren, especially their spirituall welfare. Secondly, if we be thankfull for others, much more for our selues, especially for spirituall blessings, since they are more excellent and necessary. Thirdly, heere is a reproofe of those, that if the benefit concerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they will (perhaps) be thankfull, but if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne others, they are like <hi>Plinies</hi>

Fourthly, But most of all are they to be reproued, that neglect to praise God in their own behalfes, tho they haue drunk deepely of the sweet cup of his manifold mercies: Amongst the rest, I may name them that receiue many a meale, and many a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet haue not hearts to thanke God for them. Oh how many of these are there amongst vs?</p>
                  <p>Hence we may learne, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> that thanksgiuing is a due debt, so is prayer, Almes-deedes, and all other duties, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. So that if we doe neuer so many good duties to God or man, we must not looke to merit any thing thereby, especially if we consider,

                        <item>2. that we doe it but in part, in so much that when wee haue done the best wee can, we must needs confesse that we are vnprofitable seruants.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our thanksgiuing must be continuall,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Election proceeds from Gods eternall loue,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Lord direct your hearts]</hi> By <hi>Lord</hi> is here meant the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Sense.</note> to whom it belongs to direct mans heart:<note place="margin">Oecumenus.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Direct your hearts]</hi> Here is a metaphor, intimating that our hearts are peruerse and crooked, and subiect to erre, and bend the wrong way, since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore stand in neede of good direction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Into the loue of God]</hi> These words may either be taken actiuely or passiuely: Actiuely, for that loue wherewith we loue him: or Passiuely, for that loue wherewith he loueth vs in Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And to the patience of Christ]</hi> These words may beare a double sense: The first is this; that yee may beare afflictions patiently for Christ his sake: or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that yee may patiently wait for Christ his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The summe of the exhortation is this: <hi>See that yee loue God, and that yee get assurance that God loues you; see that yee suffer patiently for Christs sake, and that yee waite with patience, till he come in glory to iudge both quicke and dead.</hi> The doctrines are these. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>In that this exhortation is vttered in manner of a prayer, we may learne, that we must not presently vpon exhortations, admonitions, or commands, infer free-will,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7911:52"/>and power to doe that which we are exhorted vnto, or admonished, or commanded. But since that oftentimes precepts in Scripture are changed into prayers, it must teach vs that power to obey is not from our selues, but from God, who <hi>workes in vs both to will and doe:</hi> Exhortations, admonitions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, shew not what we can doe, but what we ought to doe.</p>
                  <p>Here wee haue a proofe of the Trinity, <label type="milestone">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> that the Holy Ghost is true God, in that <hi>Paul</hi> prayes vnto him. Besides this, we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. hee is sayd to bee like an hen, <hi>viz.</hi> to cherish and warme the creatures, and (as it were) to put life into them, as to chickens, which no creature can doe.

                  <p>IN this verse, the Apostle vseth an Apostrophe; for hauing spoken to idle persons in the former verse, he doth in this verse, conuert his speech to those that did worke quietly, and were of ability, and by a <hi>prolepsis</hi> hee meets with them, that through auarice, would not releeue the needy poore: these he exhorts to releeue the necessity of such as did want, and that without beeing <hi>weary,</hi> tho their couetousnesse, and the ingratitude and vnworthinesse of such as were needy, might cause the same.</p>

                  <p>Excommunication must follow the contempt of <label type="milestone">

                  <p>IN this verse there is a mitigation of the seueritie of the censure, lest the excommunicated person should be swallowed vp of despaire.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7911:62"/>but admonish him mildly, as a brother, that we may bring him to repentance.</p>

Peace with the creatures is a singular blessing of God; for this will cause them (if need require, and God will so haue it) to take our parts, and to fight for vs, as the stars did once for Israel, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5.20. whereas, if wee had not peace with them, they would (if God gaue but the least becke) rise vp in armes and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, as once the stars did against <hi>Sisera.</hi>

                     <hi>viz. The grace of our Lord &amp;c.</hi>] This salutation he ordinarily vses in his Epistles, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his great loue to them to whom hee wrote, in the words we may note.<note place="margin">Parts.</note>

Out of these verses wee may gather these poynts of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, there were counterfet wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, falsely fathered vpon <hi>Paul</hi> and others; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that none might be deceiued, <hi>Paul</hi> giues his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles a marke, with his owne hands, whereby they might be discerned from spurious and counterfet wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:7911:65"/>
                  <p> In that <hi>Paul,</hi> as he began his Epistle with <hi>Grace,</hi> so hee also ends it: Wee may learne, that the grace of Christ, is a most excellent and necessary thing: Fire and water are not so necessary for the body, as grace is for the soule; and therefore it is often and againe to be asked. And whosoeuer knowes, either the worth of grace, or want of it, will much call for it; they that do not so, either they value not grace, as they ought, or feele no need of it, which is a wofull dulnesse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All our salutations and greetings, our adieu's &amp; farewels, ought to be grounded in the grace of Christ; otherwise they are but carnall: and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle biddeth the Christians, to <hi>salute one another with an holy kisse, Rom.</hi> 16.16. Or (as <hi>Peter</hi> speakes) <hi>with the kisse of loue,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wee must acknowledge Christ for our Lord, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as for our Sauiour; many can bee content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Christ, as a Sauiour, to deliuer them from Hell, but not a Lord to command them: this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brooke: They are like to those that sayd, <hi>Wee will not haue this man to raigne ouer vs, Luk.</hi> 19.14. Let such know, that damnation shall bee their lot and portion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. Those that cannot brooke Christ to bee their Lord, shall neuer haue him to bee their Sauiour: Too many such there are, in these dayes, the Lord be mercifull vnto them, and season their hearts with the salt of sauing grace, in his good time. <hi>Amen.</hi>
